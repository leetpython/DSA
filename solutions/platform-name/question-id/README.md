# Question Name

## Intuition

- Assume the reader has already read the question description and knows how to solve questions on this platform.
- Give a ***very*** brief introduction to how the problem can be solved.
- Don't put anything condescending like "Classic DP".
- Be concise. If someone has forgotten how to solve the question, they should be able to recall the approach after reading this.

## Approach

- Use ordered & unordered lists, code blocks and any other markdown features liberally.
- Math is great! Break down mathematical formulas into easily understandable chunks that can be referenced later.
- Try to include a dry run / visualization of an example.
- Do not link to external images or videos, put them in an `assets/` directory within the question if needed.
- Bonus: Try to include examples of approaches that _seem_ intuitively correct but are actually _incorrect_.

## Complexity

- Just a couple of bullet points stating the time and space complexity.
